			I have several years experience as a tutor and I enjoy what I do.

			My <b>mission statement</b> includes two parts. First, I want to help the student build a strong foundation in the subject. Second, I want to help the student gain an appreciation for the subject.

			If you are worried your student is falling behind in school, consider private tutoring.
