		<div class = "about_me">
			From the Southwest to the Midwest, and even back East, David traveled all over the United States in his college years. He made his way back to his native Southern California to pursue a career in teaching.
			His is driven by curiosity of the natural world and often wonders how and why things work the way they do. He enjoys exploring new music across all genres, reading novels, and [insert super cool hobby here].
			He created After School Tutoring after learning that the 2022 National Report Card showed reduced math and reading ability for 4th and 8th grade students.
